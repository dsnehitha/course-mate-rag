        "### Overview:\n",
        "This code implements one of the multiple ways of multi-model RAG. It extracts and processes text and images from PDFs, utilizing a multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for summarizing and retrieving content for question answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components:\n",
        "   - **PyMuPDF**: For extracting text and images from PDFs.\n",
        "   - **Gemini 1.5-flash model**: To summarize images and tables.\n",
        "   - **Cohere Embeddings**: For embedding document splits.\n",
        "   - **Chroma Vectorstore**: To store and retrieve document embeddings.\n",
        "   - **LangChain**: To orchestrate the retrieval and generation pipeline."

        "\n",
        "### Motivation:\n",
        "Efficiently summarize complex documents to facilitate easy retrieval and concise responses for multi-modal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Details:\n",
        "   - Text and images are extracted from the PDF using PyMuPDF.\n",
        "   - Summarization is performed on extracted images and tables using Gemini.\n",
        "   - Embeddings are generated via Cohere for storage in Chroma.\n",
        "   - A similarity-based retriever fetches relevant sections based on the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits:\n",
        "   - Simplified retrieval from complex, multi-modal documents.\n",
        "   - Streamlined Q&A process for both text and images.\n",
        "   - Flexible architecture for expanding to more document types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation:\n",
        "   - Documents are split into chunks with overlap using a text splitter.\n",
        "   - Summarized text and image content are stored as vectors.\n",
        "   - Queries are handled by retrieving relevant document segments and generating concise answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "The project enables multi-modal document processing and retrieval, providing concise, relevant responses by combining state-of-the-art LLMs and vector-based retrieval systems."
